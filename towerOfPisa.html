    <p class="about-size"> The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: torre pendente di Pisa) or simply the Tower of Pisa is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable
        foundation. The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th
        century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 51‚ÅÑ2 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial
        work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.
