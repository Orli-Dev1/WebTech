        Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca fortress, located in the eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, at an area of 2,430 meters. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was established as an estate for the Inca Pachakoti emperor (1438â€“1472). Often
        mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", this is the most recognizable symbol of Inca culture. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later during the Spanish conquest. Although the known was local, the
        Spaniards were not known in the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until the American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to their international attention in 1911. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with
        polished dry stone walls. Its three main buildings are: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the remote buildings have been restored in order to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
        In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored and rehabilitation continued. Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian historical temple in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007 Machu Picchu was selected as one of the seven new wonders
        of the world in an online survey around the world.
